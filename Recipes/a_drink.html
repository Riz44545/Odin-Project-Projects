 <h1> How to Make the Best Bloody Mary</h1>
 <br>
<h2>Start with high-quality ingredients</h2>
<br>

<ol>
<li>The tomato juice is the base of your cocktail, so choose a good one! I buy organic since tomatoes tend to be high in pesticide residue. R.W. Knudsen’s organic tomato juice is my favorite.</li>
<li>Choose a high quality vodka, too. Tito’s is made in Austin, Texas, and it’s my vodka of choice.</li>

<li>Add fresh cucumber, garlic and black pepper</li>
<li>Fresh peeled and seeded cucumber completely disappears into the tomato juice mixture, but adds a lot of fresh flavor.</li>

<li>Fresh garlic and freshly ground black pepper are key flavors as well. You’ll add those after you’ve blended the mixture smooth. Then you can blend the mixture for just a few seconds to retain their texture. Or, you can blend it completely smooth. Up to you!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some extra tips for you:</h2>

<li>Make a few at once</li>
<li>You really don’t want to be making these cocktails individually—it’s much easier to make a batch of four drinks in your blender at once!</li>

<li>You could divide the recipe in half to make just two cocktails. If your blender has a large capacity, you might be able to double the recipe (you might just stir in the vodka at the end, to avoid overflow).</li>

<li>Top with fun garnishes</li>
<li>I like to use fresh garnishes, like leafy celery sticks or little heirloom carrots, mini bell peppers or cherry tomatoes, and fresh lemon or lime. Add something brined, too, like dill pickles, pickled okra or cocktail olives.</li>

<li>Pro tip: Serve with a glass of water</li>
<li>You’re combining alcohol and [salty] tomato juice here, which are dehydrating ingredients. Be sure to drink water on the side!</li>
